# Marvin Dore:
From Chemistry to Code 🧪 ➡️ 💻<br><br>
I worked in a pharmacy for 10 years before trading chemical compounds for syntax. Now, I spend most<br>
of my time pushing the limits of software and exploring the many domains of computer science,<br>
so far seven years and counting.<br><br> 
Today, I’m a Senior Software Engineer and content creator, documenting my experience with algorithms, system design,<br>
and software engineering.<br><br>
